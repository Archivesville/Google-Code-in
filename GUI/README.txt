Steps for automated GUI launch:

  Step 1: Create a .bat file and place it in C:\Users\{your_username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
          ( as it contains files and applications that run everytime on system boot)
          
  Step 2: Inside the .bat file,type:
                                         pythonw C:\Task\GUI.py  
                                                  or
                           (type the complete location of the GUI.py in your system)
